# nblb2html
This python script is used for *.nblb files, just put in your *.nblb file into this script, it'll automatically extract the file &amp; output Title &amp; Pubmed_Link &amp; DOI to your clipboard!
## Requirements ##
Use ``pip install tkinker`` before your first use, basically Python(My version is 3.11.9) would automatically installed this requirement, if you're unsure that you've installed this requirement, you can use ``python -m tkinter -c "tkinter._test()"`` to check if there's any dialog pop-ed out.

## How to use this script (for beginners) ##
It's very simple to use! Git clone this repository to any folder and run this command:

### For Windows (installed Python correctly) ###
1. Just run ``python X:\[folder_location_of_cloned_repository]\nblb2html\nblb2html_enhanced.py``.
2. Python would pop-up a dialog to allow you select *.nblb that you want to extract.
3. Click "OK" and wait a sec.
4. The script would tell you how many PMID founded & copied result to your clipboard.

### For MacOS ###
